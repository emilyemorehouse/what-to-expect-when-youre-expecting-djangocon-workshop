# Visual Regression Testing

This section details an approach to visual regression testing. Feel free to read through the
documented steps below and follow along, or you can follow the commit-trail. There may be multiple
commits associated with a given step, but the step number will always be in the commit message,
like so:

```text
☔️ (Visual) 1 - Add our first test!
```

_Side note:_ I use an adapted version of https://github.com/slashsbin/styleguide-git-commit-message if
you're curious about what all of the emojis mean!
