# Regression Testing in Django

This section details testing in Django. Feel free to read through the documented steps below and
follow along, or you can follow the commit-trail. There may be multiple commits associated with a
given step, but the step number will always be in the commit message, like so:

```text
☔️ (Django) 1 - Add our first test!
```

_Side note:_ I use an adapted version of https://github.com/slashsbin/styleguide-git-commit-message if
you're curious about what all of the emojis mean!
